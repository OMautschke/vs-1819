	on a computer locally. Therefor, it is not nessecary to trust
	some service taking care of the coins. There are versions that
	store the whole blockchain locally, which is nessecary to mine
	bitcions, and others, that just store the key information

	with a mobile device. They eitther store the key informations on the
	device or just represent a frontend for a web based wallet service

	such a service has to be trustful. There are services just using a 
	user account, were the informations are stored and transacations can
	be performed. With a multi sign wallet, more then one account has to log
	in and sign a transacation for security reasons.

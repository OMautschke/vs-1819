Security features:
    -max 256 operations
    -not turing complete, no loops
    -stack based

If the language were turing complete, it would add additional complexity.
However the more complex a piece of software is, the more vulnverabilities it can possess.
Bitcoin script is completly deterministic, there is no way to implement, intentionally or unintentionally,
infinite loops, thus halting the comlpete bitcoin software.
Due to its max 256 operations and non turing completness, it is much harder to write malicious code (or impossible)

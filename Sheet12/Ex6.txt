Exercise 6

There are 3 ways to burn bitcoins:

- spending bitcoins to an adress, which is legit
  but no privat key was generated to have access to it
  
- using the OP_RETURN statement, which also enables
  to store text inside the blockchain. This can be used
  for contracts, because statments or agreements stored
  with an OP_RETURN statement inside a blockchain can not be changed
  in the future with reasonable energy investions
  
- if somebody does not claim the block reward when minig a block,
  this bitcoins do never exist and are really lost forever
  
A proof of burn is another way to have consensus in a blockchain network.
Traditionally, the user how is allowed to generate a new block and
therefor gets the block reward is choosen in a consens by investing
calculation power or owning currency in the network. With the proof
of burn, its choose by the amount of coins, the user has
burned in the past.

The second option (OP_RETURN) provides the concept for a proof-of-burn.
Its absolutly clear, that this coins are burned by checking the OP_RETURN
statement. Sending coins to a burning address is not a valid proof-of-burn
because there is no guarentee, that this coins are realy burned
and nobody has access to them.

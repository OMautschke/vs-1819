a)

Chang and Roberts:
turnaround time: 3n-1 --> O(n)
messages sent: 3n-1 --> O(n)

pros:
-asynchronous
-good example to understand ring based election algorithms

cons:
-tolerates no failures

Peterson:
turnaround time: log(n) +1 --> O(log(n))
messages sent: 2n(log(n)+1) --> O(n*log(n))

pros:
-knowlegde of n unnecessary
-asynchronous

cons:
-tolerates no failures

b)
Bully algorithm uses timeouts to detect failures, the floodmax algorithm checks each round, if there is a new leader.
If the actual coordinator in the bully algorithm needs to long to send a message there can be a false timeout.
There are no guarantees of message delivery order, resulting in different conclusion which the process the new coordinator process is.
There can be two processes anouncing themselfs coordinator, if one process replaces the crashed process with the same identifier and they announce
being a coordinator concurrently.
In the floodmax algorithm there can't be to coordinators but if all the neighbors of a process die, then the process can't communicate with
other processes anymore.
The floodmax algorithm is more reliabla than the bully algorithm.

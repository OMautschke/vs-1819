1.
- Cryptocurrencies and blockchains are inreasing in popularity.
- To process transactions, blocks are used and the maximium size of the blocks was limited
- It was designed to make Bitcoin more secure, but it is not future-proof
- With a maximum, Bitcoin is unable to handle all the transactions per second to prevent delays for consumers and businesses

2.
- Solutions take time and a lot of effort
- Because any proposal has to have support of miners, developers etc. before it can be enforced
- There were discussions by Bitcoin to increase the block size, with no probposal gaining enough traction to be adopted
- 2018 the block size was successfully upgraded from 1MB to 32MB, but it gets more expensive

3.
- One solution is a secondary layer which operates on top of a blockchain
- In theory, it can process an unlimited number of transactions
- But there are downsides concerning security

4.
- Decentralized applications do not need to fully run on a blockchain — meaning many of their processes can be processed “off-chain.”
- Off-chain scaling solutions would ensure that certain transactions are completed without miners, allowing only essential information to be synchronized
- Improvements and upgrades could also be agreed upon and implemented without the arduous process of getting approval from every stakeholder in the community
- New features could be distributed without the whole blockchain being disrupted
- The downside would be, that off-chain transactions would be harder for the public to verify, and it could also create compliance issues

5.
- Transactions will take longer and longer to process
- Blockchain platforms need to offer instantly transactions if they are going to be a viable aternative
- Fractonet worked on a “complete redesign” of the blockchain to eliminate scalability issues
- It successfully managed to process 33,888 transactions per second
- The protocol can store data on-chain as well as transactions with real data immutability
- Businesses no longer have to entrust third parties with sensitive information

- A malicious miner can try to reverse existing the transacitons of a blockchain
- A miner is supposed to broadcast the solution that was found to all other miners so that they can verify it
- The corrupted miner can create an offspring by not broadcasting the solution, than there are two versions of the blockchain
- The corrupted miner and all other miners in the network are following different versions
- Now the corrupted miner can spend Bitcoins on the trutzful version and the isolated version does not include these transaction
- The Bitcoins of the isolated one are still there
- The corrupted miner still works on the isolated blockchain as normally
- The majority of the miners add blocks to their version of the blockchain faster than the rest of the network and
  the longest chain has the majority. So its determined which version is the truth
- The corrupted miner now try to add block to his isolated blockchain faster than the others and as soon as the isolated blockchain
  is longer than the truth blockchain the miner will broadcast it to the whole network.
- All miners will detect that the corrupted version is actually longer and the protocol forces them to switch to this chain
- The corrupted blockchain is now considered the truthful blockchain, and all transactions that are not included on this chain will be reversed immediately


The malicious miner will require more hashing power than the rest of the network combined (51% of hashing power). So these
kind of attacks are extremely hard to perform. There are perhaps even hundreds of thousands of miners and even the strongest
computer on earth is not competitive with the total computational power of the whole network. So its very unlikely.


On a smaller blockchain less computing power is needed for a 51% attack, because of a smaller number of miners.
Theoretical the network would be much vulnerable, but today the networks and their blockchains are getting bigger and bigger
and the case would be nullified.

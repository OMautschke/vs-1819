The earth rotates slightly slower than the second was defined. Thus a day lasts fractions of a second 
longer than the definition of 86400 seconds. The effect accumulates with the time and to keep the time 
synchronous the so-called leap second is introduced.
The leap second is right in the middle of the smearing operation, because it minimizes the maximum offset.

When computers or a real-time-system are tightly synchronized with UTC it could not cause disruptions
if the time is synchronized with the leap second, e.g. tracking satellites. It would be expensive to modify it.
A leap second can be announced by a higher-level NTP server, an external radio clock or GPS receiver, 
or by a Leap Second File, a file containing a list of all leap seconds. Some operating systems include 
support for leap seconds, others do not. If an operating system supports leap seconds, NTP can forward 
the announcement to the kernel.

a)
- it manages time in a much cleaner fashion the net date does
- ntpd continually talk to each other and prevents drift from happening

b)
if the time difference between the provider and the consumer is small such as less than about 128ms then the NTP
protocol is going to adjust the time on the time consumer very gradually
-> slewing

if the time difference between the provider and the consumer ist large then it's going to have to make time
adjustments more quickly
-> Stepping

c)
if the time difference between the provider and the consumer ist more than 17 minutes then the NTP
damon is going to consider time to be insane.

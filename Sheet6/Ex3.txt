You would choose the third.
Resulting time:
servertime + roundtrip / 2 = 10:54:28:342 + 20/2 = 10:54:28:352
Error interval:
Computation of server, request and reply speed unknown.
Worst case: request and reply time = 1ms
=> accuracy = 20ms/2 - 2*1ms = 9ms
It would change because the accuracy with the second message is higher:
accuracy = 25ms/2 - 2*8ms = -3.5ms
You can estimate it by measuring the servers time to compute its reply and sending it
to the client => (Computation time - roundtrip time)/2

a)
PageMap only will be send once to each node. Scaling up with broadcast. Send ich node to the hadoop file system
and read them only once.

b)
Often an application needs to aggregate multiple values as it progresses and accumulators generalize
the concept called counters in MapReduce to enable this. The process can implmenented with normal reduce operator,
but with accumulators it will be nicer. In the example the accumulator is used to counter up the bad records and the
bad bytes in a filter operation. The accumulator variable also is typesafe. The difference to normal reduce oprator is
that the accumulator variables can be used in any task and simply can be called.

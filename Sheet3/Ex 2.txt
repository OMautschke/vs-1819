Exercise 2

1.

State of the art is was at the moment the paper was written manly MapReduce
The problem with existing computing frameworks was that reusage of intermediate results was
not trivial. The developer had to store results on hard disk. It was not possible to store
results in-memory. This made applications that have iterative approaches like many machine learning algorithms slow.

2.

The RDD approach has the advantage that fault tolerance does not need much performance. Due to the creation proces
of RDDs, they can be easily recreated in case of failure. RDDs are efficient when one operation is applied to all data
in a dataset. If fine-grained operations are needed, maybe shared memory is the better option.

3.

The dependencies in RDDs are represented with an inheritance tree. With this, the information how to create the RDD is light weight
and the RDD can be recreated by any worker or node that has acess to the raw data, the RDD was originally
created from

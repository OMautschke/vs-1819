IA: events e and e' are directly connected, no messages between. => e -> e' => V(e) < V(e')

IV: e -> e' => V(e) < V(e') shal be true for n messages Mn connecting events e and e'

IS: n -> n+1 messages between e and e'
    e -> M1 ->...-> Mn -> Mn+1 -> e' => V(e) < V(M1) <...< V(Mn) < V(Mn+1) < V(e')
<=> e -> Mn+1 -> e' => V(e) < V(Mn+1) < V(e') | because of IV and transitivity
<=> e -> e' => V(e) < V(e') | because of transitivity

E-gold was a digital currency which was backed by existing , non virtual gold.
It failed because it was used by drug dealers and money launderers
E-cash did not check the identity of a new user and restricted the account only after something suspicious happened which made it harder
to regulate
Because of this the founder of e-gold had to spend 3 years on probation and 6 months house arrest.
Bitcoin is decentralized over a p2p network and so and does not rely on a single company to manage the system.
If an e-currency does not comply to a countries financial regulations it can happen, that its use gets forbidden and the user can lose everything,
since its value will drop significantly.
